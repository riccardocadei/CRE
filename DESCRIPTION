Description: Provides an interpretable identification of subgroups with
    heterogeneous causal effect. The heterogeneous subgroups are
    discovered through ensemble learning of causal rules. Causal rules are
    highly interpretable if-then statement that recursively partition the
    features space into heterogeneous subgroups. A small number of
    significant causal rules are selected through Stability Selection to
    control for family-wise error rate in the finite sample setting. It
    proposes various estimation methods for the conditional causal effects
    for each discovered causal rule.  It is highly flexible and multiple
    causal estimands and imputation methods are implemented.  Lee, K.,
